# Calendar Events Alfred workflow

The calendar events workflow is used to get a list of events for today.

## Required Calendar Permissions

To read from your local calendar, the workflow requires Calendar permissions for both Alfred 5 and Terminal. Visit Systems Settings > Privacy & Security > Calendars to grant them these permissions. Make sure that you select Full Access (instead of just Add Only).

## Usage

To use, simply type the `cal` command into Alfred, and you will see a list of upcoming calendar events.

Competed events are not removed and the time is shown in a long format. The workflow is functional but not polished currently.
